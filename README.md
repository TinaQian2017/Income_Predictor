# Income_Predictor

## Functionality

The report explains the feature selection for (Adult)[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult] dataset.
There are 14 columns in the dataset, one is label and the other 13 are features. I explain how to select among
the 13 features to find the ones that we can use to better build a model to predict one's income.
